                To put everything in place, I always thought that we need to work hard for it and strive for something we want. I think that what keeps me going, the love I have with my family, God and for everything and everyone around me. They are the reason why I chose ICT because it gives me a new environment to work in. Keep Striving, life may be hard, but we’ll get there!

                Object-oriented programming (OOP), before I thought it is just another subject that we need to take. But, this taught me how to be strong enough to face the challenges brought by online classes. It is very challenging for me to take this because it is a critical one that really requires knowledge and understanding in programming and it is I think what I lack. but, Ma’am Fajardo helped me and my classmates to better understand the topic she discussed. We are free to ask questions anytime. She helped us to think outside the box and work outside our comfort zones. What I learned from her will never be forgotten, so will she.

                In OOP I learn different things that’s been helpful to me towards my success. OOP helps me to understand the basics. Although it’s hard, OOP made it enjoyable. I enjoyed every inch of the subject because it caught my attention and interest as an amateur programmer that is dreaming to be a big one someday.

                My experience in Object Oriented Programming as my academic subject helped me as a person in ways that it became a stepping stone towards my better self mentally. It helped me improve my logical and critical thinking. It also helped me manage myself when working under-pressure. About ma’am Ethel Fajardo as my professor on this subject this semester and even in the previous, she was one the reason why and how I improved my mental and emotional self by the way she teaches us practically. She wakes my mental spirit by the way she teaches through her activities/projects for us. Not many of us, her students, may have appreciated her way of teaching but for me, I believe she was an effective academic teacher. Rest in peace.

                There is no subject that you can learn in one night. There is no one masterpiece that you can create with one paint. There is no talent that you can nurture in one practice. Everything undergoes a process. Everything starts at the starting line.  My takeaway in this subject is to simply start. Learn the basics and the fundamentals. There is nothing wrong being steps behind. What matters is that you keep on learning, and you try and do your best to catch up. What matters is there is a knowledge and principle you carry as you keep moving forward and nurturing your skills.

                Late Prof. Fajardo discussed the basic knowledge that we need to know about OOP so that we will be familiar with our subject and in creating a program that is OOP based. I have learned that OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is used to make a software program that is simple and has reusable parts of code which are the classes that are used to create individual instances of objects.

              <p class="text-montserrat team-text">
                The way Prof. Fajardo demonstrates it is so effective because she did her best to not let her students be left behind in the lessons. She frequently asks us if we have questions so that we can understand the lesson very well. It’s okay to ask questions about the things that you don’t understand because a student that is asking questions is a student that is eager to learn and may have a great future ahead.

                Object Oriented Programming subject have taught me many lessons. It is both technical or conceptual. In technical terms, OOP has taught me the importance of code reusability and coding in an understandable manner. OOP has changed the way I structure my code because I came from a procedural paradigm like C. The way I write code now is much better than before I learned about the concept of OOP.
